<h2>Find Them</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A puzzle-like game, where you have to find the person you were separated from in an haunted, abandoned
old building.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want my players to feel un-easy from the music choice and style, while also feeling slightly
frustrated when trying to figure out which cracks are safe to walk over and which will break underneath them.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Puzzle/Horror(?)
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player can move using the arrow keys, and their target is to get to the person they were separated from
in the cursed place. Around the floor there are cracks, most of them are "pitfalls" and when the player collides with them
they will fall. There are only 4 safe cracks to walk on in the entire map. Through trial and error or luck the player must maneuver 
through the maze pass through the safe cracks and get to the person.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Inputting horror into my games/horror games.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
It's the first genuine horror game I've made, as well as it relies more on unsettling music and atmosphere
than jump scares. 
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
You, the player, have been separated from a person in a cursed building. Having spent awhile trying to track them down, you've finally on
the highest floor of the building. It's too dark to see the entire room, however, the floor is old and looks like it might give away in some spots. So, in order to find the lost,
you must now traverse this floor and hope for the best you don't fall.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The story is a continuation of the current predicament the player finds themselves in. The tension in the story is fleshed out in the
game through the music choice and the artwork (hopefully).Also to go along with the theme of this assignment, the player is actually the
creature that wanders the cursed building and is hunting down the poor human person.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People who aren't easily unsettled.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Approximately 3 to 5 minutes.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Trial and Error.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Music - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEfeBdvjG0g
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
It has a mix of my previous puzzle prototype, I think it was Digital-Template-4 and Digital
Template-1 for its simple options of what you can and can't do in terms of control.
